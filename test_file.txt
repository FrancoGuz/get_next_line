Punished for the boa constrictor incident, Harry is locked in his cupboard
until summer. When finally free, he spends most of the time outside his house
to escape the torments of Dudley’s cohorts. Harry is excited by the prospect of
starting a new school in the fall, far away from Dudley for the first time in his life.
One day, Uncle Vernon tells Harry to fetch the mail. Harry notices a letter bearing a
coat of arms that is addressed to him in “The Cupboard under the Stairs.” Uncle Vernon
grabs the envelope from him and shows it to his wife. Both are shocked. They force
Dudley and Harry to leave the kitchen in order to discuss what to do. The next day, Un
cle Vernon visits Harry in the cupboard. He refuses to discuss the letter, but he tel
ls Harry to move into Dudley’s second room, previously used to store Dudley’s toys.
